# Charlie the Game
Welcome to a game I wrote as a tribute to Atlassian. I did this purely for fun and it is not for broader distribution!

## Run it on my local machine
1. Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.
You can test this by running `node -v` and `npm -v`
If you do not have either installed, please follow these instructions [Installing Node & NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
2. `cd Latest`
3. `npm install`
4. `node index.js`
5. Open http://localhost:5000/ in your favourite browser & enjoy!
